Hi,I am Nidhi Kumari Agarwal currently pursuing Chemical Engineering from IIT(BHU),Varanasi.Here,I present my Project on Messaging Service Prototype.

#Motivate My Run

Motivate My Run is a fantastic project that aims to provide motivation and inspiration during runs through randomly selected text messages. To get started with this service, here's a brief overview and some additional insights:

##Installation Instructions:

1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

###Environmental Variables:

You'll need to set up environmental variables in a .env file with the following key values:

- **Database Configuration**:
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: Your database password.
  - `DB_USERNAME`: Your database username.
  - `DB_URL`: URL for your MongoDB database (e.g., mLabs hosted database).

- **Twitter Configuration**:
  - `TWITTER_TOKEN`: Twitter API token.

- **Twilio Configuration**:
  - `TWILIO_ID`: Twilio account ID.
  - `TWILIO_TOKEN`: Twilio authentication token.
  - `TWILIO_NUMBER`: Your Twilio phone number.
  - `TWILIO_TEST_TOKEN`: Twilio test authentication token.
  - `TWILIO_TEST_ID`: Twilio test account ID.

- **Other Configuration**:
  - `RECEIVING_NUMBER`: The cell phone number to which motivational texts will be sent.

##Running the Server:

To start the server, run `npm start`. The server will run locally on `localhost:3000`. To generate a motivational text message, send a GET request to `localhost:3000`. You can also deploy the server on platforms like Heroku, ensuring you set your environmental variables there.

###Setting up the Scraper:

The Twitter scraping script is located in the 'bin' folder of the project's root. If you deploy the project on Heroku, you can schedule the scraper script to run at intervals (e.g., once every hour) using Heroku Scheduler. To do this, run `scraper.js` in Heroku Scheduler.

##Documentation:

For more detailed information, you can refer to the automatically generated documentation from JSDocs, which can be found [here](https://jonathanwmaddison.github.io/MotivateMyRun/documentation/global.html).

##Testing:

The project includes linting and testing tools:
- Run `npm run-script lint` to analyze all JavaScript files in the project based on Google linting standards.
- Run `npm test` to execute a few Mocha/Chai tests. You can customize and expand these tests as needed.

Ensure that you have proper permissions and access to the necessary services like Twitter, MongoDB, and Twilio to set up and run this project successfully. Additionally, consider personalizing the motivational messages to make them more inspiring and engaging for your users.
